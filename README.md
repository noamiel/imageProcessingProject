# imageProcessingProject
This project is some parts of a project based on image processing and deep learning in order to identify dicentric chromosomes in lymphocitic culture cells. 
There are 2 scripts:
The first is used for identification of 2 centromers in an isolated chromosome. 
The second is a draft of basic image cleaning from noise, and can be used for any noisy image.
